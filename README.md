Healthcheck middleware for Express.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/115940.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/115940?preload=1&autoplay=1&speed=1.7)

## Purpose

`express-physical` is intended to be more or less a port of [physical](https://github.com/alde/physical). The intention is to have Dropwizard-style healthchecks for Node.

## Installation

```shell
npm install --save express-physical
# or
yarn add express-physical
```

## Usage

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const physical = require('express-physical')

const app = express()

const passingCheck = () => physical.response({
  name: 'Sample passing check',
  actionable: false,
  healthy: true,
  type: physical.type.SELF
})

app.use('/healthcheck', physical([passingCheck]))
```

`/healthcheck` will respond with the result of all checks, with a status code of 200.

## API

```javascript
const physical = require('express-physical')
```

The `physical` function expects an array of `Check`s and returns a middleware.

### `physical([Check])`

Returns a middleware that returns an object with the currently healthy and unhealthy checks:

```
const middleware = physical([alwaysPassing, alwaysFailing])

// Will send a 200 OK with the following payload:

{
  "healthy": [{
    "name": "Always passing",
    "actionable": false,
    "type": "SELF",
    "healthy": true
  }],
  "unhealthy": [{
    "name": "Always failing",
    "actionable": false,
    "type": "SELF",
    "healthy": false,
    "message": "What can you do...?",
    "severity": "WARNING"
  }]
}
```

### Check(fn)

`Check` is not a class provided by `physical`, it is simply a function with one of two forms:

```javascript
//Synchronous check
const synchronousCheck = function () {
  return physical.response(...)
}

// Async Check
const asyncCheck = function (done) {
  done(physical.response(...))
}
```

The check must always return or call the callback with a `physical.response`.

If the check throws an error, it will be forwarded to the next middleware where it has to be handled by the application. It will **not** be caught by the `physical` middleware and treated as a failing check.

### `physical.response({ options })`

| Option | Description | Mandatory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` string | A descriptive name | Yes |
| `healthy` boolean | | Yes |
| `type` physical.type | The type of this check | Yes |
| `severity` physical.severity | | When the check is unhealthy |
| `actionable` boolean | Whether or not the owner can act on this check failing | Yes |
| `message` string | | When the check is unhealthy |
| `dependentOn` string | The name of a service that this check relies on | When the `type` is one of `INFRASTRUCTURE`, `INTERNAL_DEPENDENCY` and `EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY`. Excluded otherwise.
| `info` object{string,object} | Object of any depth with additional info about this check. | No |
| `link` string | A URL to where more information can be found | No

If your `physical.response` is invalid, an `InvalidHealthcheckResponse` error will be thrown. The original response data is available at `InvalidHealthcheckResponse.responseData`.

### `physical.type`

Constants representing the type of a check.

* `SELF`
* `METRICS`
* `INFRASTRUCTURE`
* `INTERNAL_DEPENDENCY`
* `EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY`
* `INTERNET_CONNECTIVITY`

### `physical.severity`

Constants representing the severity of a failing check.

* `WARNING`
* `CRITICAL`
* `DOWN`

## Prior art

* [express-healthcheck](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-healthcheck) - A little _too_ simple for my use case, where I can have multiple independently failing checks where I want to provide data regarding all of them. `express-physical` could be implemented within `express-healthcheck`, but I'm looking for something a little more structured.
* [node-healthchecks](https://github.com/broadly/node-healthchecks) - Checks the system by trying to request public resources, but couldn't, for example, tell you if you're unable to connect to the database.
* Heavily inspired by [physical](https://github.com/alde/physical). The API contract is essentially the same.

## Tips

### Some of my healthchecks are more expensive than others to run

`express-physical` does not expose a way to configure the interval at which healthchecks are invoked. If one of your healthchecks is too expensive to be run every time your monitoring system polls the healthcheck endpoint, throttle your function call so that it returns a cached value if called multiple times within a certain interval.

### I need to pass arguments into my healthcheck

Checks _need_ to receive either one or zero arguments, where that argument is a callback that will be provided by `express-physical`. If you have to pass more arguments into it, pass them when you create the check rather than at time of invokation.

```
const (db) => (done) => db.isHealthy((err, res) => done(physical.response({ ... })))
```

### Avoiding repeating data for `responses`

Use a higher-order function to avoid having to repeat certain elements when creating `responses`. Ex.

```javascript
const physical = require('express-physical')

const createDatabaseHealthCheck = (data) => (db) => (done) => {
  if (db.connection.readyState === 1) {
    done(Object.assign({}, data, physical.response({
      healthy: true,
      actionable: false
    })))
  } else {
    done(Object.assign({}, data, physical.response({
      healthy: false,
      actionable: true,
      severity: physical.severity.CRITICAL,
      message: 'Failed to connect to db'
    })))
  }
}

const canConnectToDatabase = createDatabaseHealthCheck({
  name: 'Database connection',
  type: physical.type.INTERNAL_DEPENDENCY,
  dependentOn: {
    serviceName: 'mongodb'
  }
})(db)

app.use('/healthcheck', physical([canConnectToDatabase]))
```

## Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome. However, if your contribution goes beyond bug fixing, it is recommended that you first [create an issue](https://github.com/Nevon/express-physical/issues/new), in order to agree on a solution before investing time into implementing something that may not be merged. Changes that affect the schema are very unlikely to be accepted.

### Testing

Contributions are expected to be tested to a reasonable degree.

* Run unit tests with `npm run test:unit`
* Run API tests with `npm run test:integration`
* Run the linter with `npm run lint`

### Formatting

Formatting is done using [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier). There is a pre-commit hook that should format your code automatically, but if you want to manually format it, run `npm run format`.

### Benchmarks

If you are concerned with the performance implications of your change, there are benchmarks that you can run to find out. In order to run them, you need to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed. Information on [how to install Docker is available here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

To run the benchmarks, run `npm run benchmark`. The benchmarks will be run against your local branch and a reference version of physical. Some variance is to be expected, but if your change has a drastic impact, consider creating an issue to discuss it if you need help.

To change the reference version of physical that you want to run the benchmarks against, change the version in [scripts/performance/benchmarks/package.json](scripts/performance/benchmarks/package.json) and run `npm run benchmark:rebuild`.

**ðŸ“£ Note that the benchmarks are a work in progress. Contributions for adding more benchmarks are very welcome!**
